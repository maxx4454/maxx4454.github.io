how to solve conflicts:
1. i love you and appreciate you
2. we have a conflict. im hurt and you are hurt (feelings > positions)
3. lets be adults and figure out some solution towards common good
4. if you are not ready for that im afraid we have to part ways

don't question her feelings: if she says she feels uncomfortable about something, dont say "why???? it's nothing"
